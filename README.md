# Project Overview
This project involves building a machine learning model to predict whether a loan application will be approved or not. The model utilizes classification algorithms and various techniques to clean and process the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrices.

The model predicts loan approval outcomes based on various applicant features, such as income, credit history, and loan amount. It aims to aid in automating and optimizing the loan approval process.

# Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Then, install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


# Running the Notebook

Step 1: Clone or Download the Repository
Clone or download the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Loan_Application_Predictor.git
```

Step 2: Install Required Dependencies
Install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Step 3: Launch Jupyter Notebook
Open the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Step 4: Open and Run the Notebook
In Jupyter Notebook, open the file Loan_Application_Predictor_Analysis.ipynb and run the cells. The notebook contains the entire process, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

# Model Insights
The model's performance is evaluated using several metrics, including:

Confusion Matrix: Displays how well the model predicts loan approvals.

True Positives (TP), False Positives (FP), True Negatives (TN), and False Negatives (FN) are computed to assess the model’s performance.

Feature Importance Analysis: Identifies which features (e.g., income, credit history) play the most significant role in predicting loan approval.

Despite experimenting with different techniques like feature importance analysis and hyperparameter tuning, the current model, which maintains dataset quality and simplicity, delivers the best performance.


# Key Findings
- The model performs well at identifying negatives (True Negatives = 79 vs. False Negatives = 3), but struggles to capture positives (True Positives = 11 vs. False Positives = 18).
- Hyperparameter tuning did not yield a significant improvement and even led to a performance drop compared to the initial model.
- Feature importance analysis could provide valuable insights but requires dropping certain variables, which would affect dataset integrity.

# Contributions 

Feel free to open issues or pull requests if you have suggestions for improving the model or if you encounter any bugs.
