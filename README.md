# Project Overview
This project involves building a machine learning model to predict whether a loan application will be approved or not. The model utilizes classification algorithms and various techniques to clean and process the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrices.

The model predicts loan approval outcomes based on various applicant features, such as income, credit history, and loan amount. It aims to aid in automating and optimizing the loan approval process.
